Final Project for CS183
LiveInvader

An elementary social network loosely based off of Instagram. Users will be able to have a profile, have followers, be followed, and upload their photos to a db of sorts that will auto-crop the images to fit in the grid design of an individual’s profile, (done through css). Features should include a user being able to like, and (if we have time ), comment on a user’s photo. A brief tour (in English) of the site, from the viewpoint of a typical user. When the user is NOT logged in, the only thing they can see is some kind of splash screen that prompts them to either login or make an account. Once the user is logged in, they will be able to see a “feed” of images from the people they follow. For now, maybe the 10 most recent posts will show up on the feed. The user will have the ability to comment, and “like” these pictures. The user will also have a profile for themselves, which will show their number of posts, followers, people they follow, and a grid of their photos. For uploading a photo, they should be a separate page layout dedicated to the structure of it. Which will provide an interface (form) for the image upload, and the caption they want to provide.
